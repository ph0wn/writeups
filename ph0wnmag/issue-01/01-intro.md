# Welcome to Issue 01

# Foreword

*"What was the solution to this #@* challenge?! What did I miss?"*

We hope to put an end to this frustration with this first issue of Ph0wn eMag, the first magazine for CTF writeups!

We thank all who contributed to this issue: our very fine Ph0wn staff of course, but also a few *external* contributors who spent time detailing a solution.

Enjoy and feel free to send us alternative solutions, or other writeups!
