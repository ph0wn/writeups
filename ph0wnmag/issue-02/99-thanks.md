# Thanks

Free events are free to you because sponsors pay for you. If you want to keep Ph0wn free, please ask your employer to sponsor us: contact@ph0wn.org

- **SERMA**, whose support, enthusiasm and workshops go to our heart,
- **PentHertz**, a easy going sponsor we can count on,

# What's next?

If you live close to Sophia Antipolis, check out the activities of [Sophia Hack Lab](https://www.shl.contact/). They are going to propose regular *Ph0wn Warm Up* sessions, where you'll play CTF, or learn IoT hacking.

Also, we need **sponsors for the next edition**! Please ask your employers to sponsor us. We typically needs sponsor which provide:

1. **Equipment**. 20x the same device, and we can make a challenge out of it! But we need that early! Before June!
2. **Prizes**. 
3. **Money**. Especially for speaker and organizer travel costs.

It is especially helpful if we can get *early* sponsors (before June), because we can plan ahead.
