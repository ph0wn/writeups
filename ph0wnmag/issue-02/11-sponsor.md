# Ph0wn Sponsorship

Nothing is **free**. If Ph0wn is free to you, it's because *sponsors pay for you*. Once again, we thank our sponsors dearly.

In 2024, we had a hard time finding new sponsors. Consequently, we went from a budget which was working well in 2023, to a tight budget in 2024. 

Where does the budget go? There are a few visible expenses like the lunch, the equipment and the prizes. Previous year T-shirts had to be abandonned: it's only 15-20 euros per T-shirt, but it's a higher amount multiplied by 200. But there are also "hidden" expenses. In 2024, for instance, we had difficulty **covering expenses for our remote speakers and organizers**. They agree to share time and knowledge freely, the least we can do is cover their expenses. We managed to this year, and it's important to have enough budget for that in future editions.

>**What can you do**? Please ask your employer to support us. We are generally looking for:
>
>1. Equipment that can be turned into challenges.
>2. Sponsor for Ph0wn-related prizes.
>3. Sponsor for travel/hotel expenses.
>4. Sponsor for hidden costs like cleaning, security, banners etc
