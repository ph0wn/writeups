Pico is a space exploration enthusiast. 

He acquired an AGC module from an Apollo rocket and has started reverse engineering it. To aid in his endeavor, he forked the Hydrabus project. 
But Pico never takes the bus, he only travels with his personal jet plane, so he renamed the project Hydrajet.

Pico is particularly intrigued by the command aspect of the AGC. He has discovered a serial link between the keyboard and the computing unit, noting the use of a serial connection. Consequently, he implemented an AGC command decoder. The question remains: did he do it correctly? Get the flag.

Equipment needed: one HydraJet, ST-Link, Serial module.
