This challenge consists in a customized scenario for the board game "Chronicles of Crime - London Forensic / Enquetes Criminelles". 

A few board games are available by the organizer's area. You can go and play there. Please handle the games with care (some are our personal). Do not mix cards between boxes. Do not take cards or any other element to your team's table. Everything stays in place :)
If there are not enough board games, we'll provide pictures of cards. The game plays exactly the same, you'll scan those pictures within the app.

To minimize time playing with the board game, 

1. Learn how to play the game BEFORE you go to the table
2. Download the necessary app on your phone or table BEFORE you go to table 
3. Load the Ph0wn scenario and start it on your device BEFORE you go to the table.
