We were told that Pico has a secret for you. But, to get this secret, you need to find Pico, and chat with him. This secret, which is a flag `ph0wn{..}` will be in a hidden place. Discover this place, and the flag will be obvious. This is also useless asking for the flag directly without being in that hidden place.

To start looking for Pico, connect to:
`nc chal.ph0wn.org 9037`

and send your [team key](/teamkeys)

```
MyLovelyKey
```

If the server tells you that the key is valid, start with the story by sending:

```
[start]
```

Each time you want to go to a new location, enter: 

```
[location name]
```

For instance:

```
[Paris]
```

A location can also be an object in which humans and crocodiles can fit: 
`[sportcar]` and `[mirage2000]` are for instance valid locations.

Don't forget to search places in which you go: this is an exploration game.

Otherwise, you are free to ask whatever question you want to find Pico. Have fun!

Important note: you are limited to 250 messages, so focus on the main objective...


A few advices:

- This challenge is based on ChatGPT. So, answers might be slow to come, be patient :-)
- If at some point you get lost in the story, simply come back to a known location
- If for some reason your client crashes ... or our server ... simply start again from your latest location
- Use new locations only by using [location name], any other way to change of location is not supported
- No bruteforcing: your number of questions is limited.
