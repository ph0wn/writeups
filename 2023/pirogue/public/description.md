Lately, several customers of "Bank Pico de Monaco" have been reporting bank credential theft.
The customers connect their laptops & smartphones to a PiRogue WiFi. 
You have access to the Grafana interface of PiRogue: 

- Grafana: http://10.210.16.194:3000

In both cases, the credentials are `admin/PiRogue`.
Please investigate the case.

Remarks:

- PiRogue: https://pts-project.org thanks to @U+039b
- Please do *not* change configuration of Grafana (do not modify the password etc)
- Be sure to be connected to the Ph0wn WiFi for any of your network queries
