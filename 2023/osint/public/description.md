Digging through Pico's trash reveals a mix of items: old champagne bottles, empty caviar boxes... and electronic cards.

Here's one that's a bit surprising... but maybe not so much?

Your task is to uncover the common name of the device by the organizer's desk and its commercial name, both in lowercase.

For instance, if this card belonged to a Tesla, the flag would be:
`ph0wn{car_tesla}`

Happy browsing on the internet :-)
