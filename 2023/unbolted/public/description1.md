In fair Wooku Manor, where passions thrive,
Pico le Croco yearns for his love to arrive.
As Romeo sought Juliet in days of yore,
Locked doors hinder Pico, this he deplores.

To see his Juliet, his heart's desire,
A locked door burns with an unquenched fire.
To dump the memory, he knows he must dare,
Unlocking pathways to reach her fair.

"O Juliet, your absence leaves me torn,
Locked doors keep us distanced and forlorn.
To dump the memory, this task I pursue,
Unlocking barriers, to be with you true."

Like Romeo's love, persistent and strong,
Pico seeks Juliet, though fate does him wrong.
Through locked doors and memory's plight,
Love's perseverance shall grant them the light.
