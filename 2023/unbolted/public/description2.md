In Wooku Manor's maze, love's tale takes flight,
Pico, the ardent suitor, glimpses Juliet's light.
Facing yet another lock, his heart in a race,
The serial port, a barrier to embrace.

With urgency, he must connect and align,
Time, the essence, as the stars start to incline.
"Oh, Juliet, within this port doth lie,
The key to reunite, under night's celestial sky.

Time, a fleeting wisp in fate's grand design,
Unlocking this port, our destinies entwine."
