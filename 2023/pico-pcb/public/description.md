Go upstairs to the Soldering area and get a Pico PCB - **1** per team max. Solder all resistors on the back: 7x 1206, 2x 0805, 2x 0603, 2x 0402 and 2x0201.

Get your flag when Pico le Croco smiles with all his teeth and eyes :)

- Solder upstairs (or outdoor) not downstairs please.
- If you are using our equipment, there's a 30-minute timer. 
- If you are using your own equipment, take the time you need :)
