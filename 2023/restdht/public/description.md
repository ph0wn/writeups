Pico le Croco's spa is controlled via a REST API on http://10.210.17.130:8080 + see code.
He wants to raise the temperature and humidity of his spa.
Can you help him be happy?

The **test** device which runs http://10.210.17.130:8080 is meant to help you craft your exploit. You may not touch it.

Two **validation** devices, identical to the test one, are available on a table close the organizers (ask them if you can't locate it). You sit at that table, and use one of the devices to validate your exploit and get your flag.  
The validation devices remain on that table at all times: you may *not* borrow them and take them away.
The validation stage is expected to be quick: test, flag and go. If you need more time, go back to the online test device.
