Your ultimate goal (in stage 2) is to communicate with the satellite EchoStar XXI.

In a first step, transmit to a terrestrial gateway at 868Mhz.
Crocodiles have no antenna, but they have brains, a PCB board and a solder iron. Tune your antenna with the VNA.
When it's matched, borrow the terrestrial terminal, use the serial port and send over your email address to receive the flag.

Send your email adress over the air to get your flag.
