Roger, your neighbour, has **diabetes**. Basically, this disease concerns *blood sugar level*. There are several causes such as a pancreas which fails to produce enough insulin, autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells etc. 

Both **hyperglycemia** (very high blood sugar) or **hypoglycemia** (low blood sugar) are major health risks. Constant high blood sugar can damage organs over time. Reciprocally, critically low blood sugar can lead to immediate death.

Because of that, Roger - like all other people with diabetes - needs to keep a constant eye on his blood sugar level. Patients typically routinely prick their finger to read blood sugar on a tiny drop of blood. This is not very convenient. Roger prefers to use a connected glucose meter. He wears the sensor on his arm, and simply checks his blood sugar level on his personal account with his Android smartphone (see app below).

Today, you quarrelled with Roger over Star Wars episodes. He said that he loved "Rogue One" and "The Last Jedi" and called you names because you said "A new hope" was the only true brillant episode.
Calling you names?! You're going to teach him respect! You're the World's Best Hacker and he definitely trusts IoT too much. You've decided you're going to scare him a little...
