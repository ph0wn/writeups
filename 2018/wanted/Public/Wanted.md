The guy who was meant to implement the hardware challenge for ph0wn has disappeared. 
Nevertheless, he left us this device - that'll you come and get at our organizer's desk (get a time slot) - and it appears that he's trying to communicate with us, one way or another...

Note: 
- to avoid white smoke, please **NEVER** connect two VCC at the same time on the board.
- USB port is **not** useful for solving the challenge
