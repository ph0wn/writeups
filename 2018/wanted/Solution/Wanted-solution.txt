The board contain a flag to recover.

When you powerup it, the red LED is flashing in morse a password, but that’s not the flag.
The UART is sending:  “Was a good idea, but the flag isn't here. This is a forensic challenge.”
You must use a ST-LINK to dump the flash and see there is beside the usual code a ZIP file.
Extract the zip file from the flash, open it and unzip the picture with the Morse password from the beginning “painfullmorsecode1337”.
Open the picture, admire the lazy croco and grab the flag.
