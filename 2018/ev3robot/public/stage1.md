Ph0wn aliens have abducted my coke and put it in the fridge. But, now, I am thirsty. Open the door with the robotic arm, and you will get a free coke ... and a flag!

Fortunately, the aliens have left a few instructions in case they would format their internal memory.

- You first have to connect to the robot using BT or USB
- Once connected, you have to make a program to move the arm and open the door. The door must rotate of 180 degrees to get the can.
- The flag is NOT in the robot system, it is printed on the coke can. 

Oh, by the way, a very powerful lazer beam will strike your own computer if you were to erase to content of the system, or if you get the can without using the robotic arm.

Last but not least, they have noted the login/password on a post-it just next to the printed manual:

- Login: `robot`
- Password: `maker`

The flag has the usual format.
