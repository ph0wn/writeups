**Pico The Croco** is very certainly the greatest crocodile on Earth. Big teeth, beautiful skin, smart etc.
Or, at least, he thinks so.
Like Caesar, Pico decided he wanted to leave his own mark in this world. He chose to appear in one of the greatest game ever: **Pacman**.
Damn! He inadvertently left a ph0wn flag...

You can download Pico's version of Pacman below. Depending on the tools you use, you might have to call this game `puckman.zip` or `puckmanb.zip`.

This challenge can be solved using the arcade machine. Or not.
Please be gentle on the game pads!

**This challenge uses a special flag format: the flag begins and ends with a `!`. Example: `!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx!`**
