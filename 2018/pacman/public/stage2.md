Have you solved Pacman 1? Yes? No? Well, if you haven't, let me warn you that **Pico The Croco** does not like n00bs.

While this stage drives you crazy, you may entertain yourself and play Pacman on the arcade machine. Not sure this will really help you out, because as we told you, this is not for n00bs.

*This challenge shares the same files as Pacman 1*

**Like Pacman 1, this challenge uses a special flag format where the flag begins and ends with a `!`**
