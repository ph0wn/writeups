The invasion has started.

The alien force is trying to take over the power. Literally.

Something has gone horribly wrong with this smart plug. And I wanted to make
everything right. I set a strong password to make sure nobody fiddles with the
configuration of this fragile piece of IoT, and yet here we are ...

Please help me. I've noted the plug's WiFi on its side, I trust you to know how
to handle this computer stuff. 

Ah, one last thing: I wouldn't pair this thing with my smartphone. Ever. Really
not. I'm serious. That's not a joke. YOU COULD BRICK THIS PIECE OF ART.
