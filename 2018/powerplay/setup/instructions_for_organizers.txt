To reset the challenge:
- Plug the plug, push the button for 10s until you hear a soft 'click' (you
  might need to push twice).
- Connect to the plug's wifi.
- Run the `reset.py` script

That should be it. Distribute __ONLY__ the `description.txt` file to the participants.
The flag is by default set to `ph0wn{kahZoo0w}`, you can change the value by
passing another `--flag` parameter to the `reset.py` script.
