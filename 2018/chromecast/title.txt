Chromecast


Our company has just acquired a chromecast to display information for employees. However, we suspect that someone found a way to take control of what is displayed! We need you to help us on this!

To avoid being detected when investigating, you will be allowed to connect to our local switch for 15min only. Please come and get a time slot at the organizer's desk.

You may use ports 1 to 7 on the FortiSwitch.
