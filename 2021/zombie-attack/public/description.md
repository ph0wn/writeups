## Zombie attack

The world has been invaded by Zombies ... But you still stand against this invasion.

Start Resident Evil, the game of the cartridge, and the revelation will come ...  your name will be revealed: this is the flag.


## Important info on flag

The flag is NOT in the usual format "ph0wn{...}": this is simply the name of the only user of the cartridge game.

## Be responsible

Challenges are for fun and education. So:

- Be gentle with the 2DS
- Do not remove the cartridge
- Do not attempt to open the 2DS nor the cartridge
- Do not format the console
- Do not remove games on the console (unless you want to be attacked by Zombie kids)
