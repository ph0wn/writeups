You've been part of a shady hackers organization for a while now, and your team is preparing a big shot.

A new cryptocurrency, ph0wncoin is flooding the market and claiming to be THE nextgen currency. You know for a fact that this is not even close to be true, and that this is just a cover for a new centralized currency.

However, your team has been passively trying to find vulnerabilities to infiltrate the central server, located at `challenges.ph0wn.org:12346`, without success... The authentication mechanism seems strong enough and resisted all kind of enumerations and exploits, but today one of your pentester teammates managed to find an entrypoint to eavesdrop on what appears to be the authentication logs sent to an ELK instance : `challenges.ph0wn.org:12345`. A reverser from your team managed to build the source code generating these logs from the public client binary. It's now your job as a cryptanalyst to find a way to get into this server (a flag will be waiting for you there).
