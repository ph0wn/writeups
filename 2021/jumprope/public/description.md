Are you fit? It's time to prove it with our **connected jump rope**.

The jump rope, manufactured by Renpho, is connected by *Bluetooth* to a [smartphone app](https://apkpure.com/renpho-fit/com.renpho.fit) (com.renpho.fit), and features 3 different modes:

1. Jump for a target amount of time
2. Jump for a target amount of jumps
3. Free mode, where you do want you want

At ph0wn, we want geeks, right? So, we'd like you to initiate *a jump workout session for 1337 target jumps without the smartphone app* (i.e you must understand how to do it on your own).

To validate your answer - and prove you are not cheating - please validate your Bluetooth commands on our [Ph0wn Jump Rope](http://34.140.103.157:3339), located at `http://34.140.103.157:3339`.

The *Ph0wn Jump Rope* replicates the real Renpho rope, except there is no rope and it does send any Bluetooth packets.

Note:

- Please handle the jump rope with care. Do not modify the length of the rope.
- **Do not attempt to flash a new firmware** on the jump rope.
- Do not open, tear down the jump rope! This is not a hardware challenge.
- **Do not fuzz** the jump rope: the security of this smart object is uncertain, and you're likely to brick it. Do not try anything that might *brick* the jump rope. You should only do things you understand... 
- The *Ph0wn Jump Rope* won't help you solve this challenge. Don't try to hack it.
- **Disconnect** outside of your time slot.
- **Do not send BLE packets** or attempt to connect to the jump rope outside  your time slot: this would probably disrupt other teams. Please be fair play.
- If you absolutely need to **reset** the jump rope, remove the batteries and replace them to reset the device.
- When you jump, we kindly ask you ensure you won't *break anything around you*, or *hurt* anyone (or yourself). You can go outside to test it.
