Pico the Croco has dug an old floppy disk of one of his first hacks, when he managed to infiltrate an authentification system. The small authenticator program (its size is 3 records only...) is still there along with the Id database (only 5 records), but unfortunately the system disk has faded up.

Hopefully there are emulators and archives on the net that will allow him to run the program again, but now the program asks him for an id and a password, and Pico doesn't fully remember his own id (and don't ask him for his password, that's more than 35 years old after all).

Yet, Pico remembers Niklaus Wirth was recognized by the authentication system, and that Pr. Wirth never hid his password ("Oberon is as simple as possible"). Of course the authenticator has all the ids, passwords and greetings in the greetings file, but they are all encrypted. That's too bad because there's a first flag for you in his greeting, and even a second flag in Pico's password (really? wow, that sounds like an anomaly in space-time continuum...).

Pico would gladly accept help from Martin Odersky or Peter Sollich, but these guys are way too busy now, so will you help him and catch these flags ?
It's time to reverse that M-Code, in every sense...

**Flags**: There are 2 flags to find for this challenge, 1 for "Lost Legacy 1" and 1 for "Lost Legacy 2". You should normally find the first flag (for "Lost Legacy 1") before the second, but it is not totally impossible you find them in a different order. If this is the case and you find a valid flag but it is "not valid", try it on "Lost Legacy 2" (or reciprocally).
