The Gnomes of Zurich have recently installed 4 surveillance cameras in their bank, to check on their Megabuck vaults. Those are remote IP cameras, they typically manage them through their Web UI or Telnet.

To monitor their network - because the Gnomes are serious about Megabucks! - the Gnomes have configured Fortinet products. The network is segmented using a FortiSwitch, security profiles are configured on the FortiGate, and all logs pile nicely in a FortiAnalyzer.

Damn it! Something is wrong: several of your IP cameras are not longer responding to Telnet. Have a close look to *packets on your network*.

## Be Responsible

Challenges are for fun and education. To make this one even more interesting and challenging for you, the ongoing attack in your workspace is a **real** attack.

Consequently, **do not run nor copy any infected binary** outside your team workshop.

Caution: if you wish to analyze the infected samples, you may download them on your own laptop and inspect them statically. But **do not run / execute** or you risk to infect your own laptop!!! **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**.

Do not drop any infected samples on your friend's PC, your boss, your grand mother or anybody, even as a joke, it would not be funny but irresponsible. Thank your for your cooperation.

PS. Actually, we're not total fools, we've disabled as much malicious payload as we could.
