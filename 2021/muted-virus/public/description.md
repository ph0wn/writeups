***Urgent news*** 
The virus has muted again, che merda!

Scientists have started to analyze it, they have already noticed that spikes have evolved, they have even made a 3d model of these modifications - but they are not very good programmers-, thinking that the sizes of the spikes influence the dangerosity, but now they seem stuck.

Save the world, help the scientists!

The light is in the openscad file.
