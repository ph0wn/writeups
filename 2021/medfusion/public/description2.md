Mmm. That infusion pump you accessed at Step 1 delivers very strange medication!
Maybe you should look into it before somebody gets sick (well, sicker than initially, we mean)...

Reminder: `medfusion.ph0wn.org`

Note:

- Please leave the pump in the same status as you got it. 
- This is a shared equipment. If you think it needs to be reset, please contact us.
- **Test your exploits locally**, you don't want to harm a patient, do you?
- The Drug Server has a 30 seconds timeout.
