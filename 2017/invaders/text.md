1978 - A new game has been installed in arcades : Ph0wn Invasion !
Wow, wow, wow, wait... you have already seen this game, it's more than a
clone, it rather looks as a *bootleg* of the arcade favorite!
Your mission is to unmask the piracy by revealing an hidden message
forgotten by the lame bootlegger!
Hopefully you will be helped by an insider: the saucer ship has decided to
reveal two buttons combinations to the most patient players (or the CTF
seekers who don't believe in luck...).
Enter these two combinations in sequence in demo mode to reveal the piracy
protector!
