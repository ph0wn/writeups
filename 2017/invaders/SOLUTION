* Install the MAME emulator.
* Install the invaders.zip file in mame/roms/

* Then, use the web page on space invaders easter eggs:
http://www.computerarcheology.com/Arcade/SpaceInvaders/

I you compare, with hexdump, the code at 0x19a, you can note that the sequence of keys to activate the easter egg has been changed with regards to te original code.

Original code
19A5: D6 72           SUB     $72                 ; 0111_0010 1st sequence: 2Pstart, 1Pshot, 1Pleft, 1Pright

In the new code:
0x34 instaead of 0x72


Same for the second sequence :
original:
19B0: FE 34           CP      $34                 ; 0011_0100 2nd sequence: 1Pstart, 1Pshot, 1Pleft

new code:
0x52

By trying to find which key correspong to which mask,
We deduce the new sequence of keys:
p1-Start, Fire, Left and p2-Start, Fire, Right.

Do ths during the demo playing the game. You should obtain a red message:"TAITO COP"
