Title: Home Alarm
Category: Android
Difficulty: 250

My friend has lent me his house for some vacations on the sunny French riviera while he's traveling elsewhere. His house is protected with a home safety alarm which can be controlled using an Android app.

He sent me the Android application and the credentials file to be inserted in the application's private data storage. Depending on your system, this should be in  `/data/data/ph0wn/ctf/alarm/files/settings.dat` or in `/data/data/ph0wn.ctf.alarm/files/settings.dat`.

Damn! How silly! He forgot to give me the alarm phone number and secret code or the passphrase to unlock the credentials!

Am I sleeping under the stars tonight? Please stop the alarm, retrieve the alarm's phone number and secret code ... and the flag.
