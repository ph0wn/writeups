Title: Smart B33r

Stage 1
-------------

This morning, our management came up with a great idea. Yes, for once, it was **really** a great idea: a **smart draught beer-tapping machine**!

We decided to implement it right away, and you'll be working on our Arduino prototype. Come and get one, and see if you get closer to b33r.

Nota. Oops, we forgot to set up the wifi.

Rules:

- Book a time slot to get the Arduino prototype
- Please do not physically destroy our prototype.

Stage 2
-------------

Did you get stage 1 flag? Well done.
Or not? And you want to start the hard way? Up to you!

There's a second flag to find on our Arduino board.
Good luck.

Please come and book a time slot for the board.
