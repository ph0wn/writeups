Now you can play with the OEM setup menu. Someone told me developers are eternal kids. They’ve include an easter egg when Winter Is Coming. Just found it in the firmware, find a way to call it and see what happen on screen.


Advice 1: the serial function is a little buggy, you should send your payload by packet of 16 bytes, and do a little 10ms pause, and then continue sending the next chunk.

Advice 2 : The firmware is provided in .elf and .bin format. It's the same version, it's up to you to use your preferred format, but a strong advice is to use the .elf file. 

Advice 3: the function at @ 0x800CA88 is only here to hide the flag. Solve this task will never ask you to reverse this complex obfuscation function. If you do, you’ll lose time and all the interest of the challenge.


To score this challenge please enter a flag in the form of 'Ph0wn{xxxxx}'.
