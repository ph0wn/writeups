# Provide

Hey! I'd like to spy on Ph0wn participants, because you know, they look like weird geeks :=)
Maybe I can do some spying with this FortiCam unit?


# Set up for organizers

## Power

Power to the FortiCam is provided by the 

- Strange issue: if port 1 has a network cable, unplug and plug again to provide power to port 4 where the FortiCam is connected.
- Plug in FortiCam to port4. If there is no power, go the [web interface](http://192.168.1.99) of the FortiSwitch and ensure that PoE is enabled for that port.


## How

I set up Recording, scheduled at a given exact date and time, for a few seconds. The recording goes on the SD card I have inserted.


## Re-setting the webcam between participants

### Resetting the Web UI

Log on the web ui, maintenance, and upload `config_file.bin`.

Make sure the videos are still presend on the SD card.

### Restoring the videos

Copy the record directory as such on the SD card.
The SD card is to be inserted face down when seeing the front of the camera.
To remove the SD card, might need to open it...

### Resetting the camera

If the webcam is really in bad state, you'll have to perform a hardware reset: that's the small button on the side, next to the SD card. Press it for 20 seconds.

Then, connect to the webcam (245), upload the `config_file.bin` or ensure to change the IP address.
If possible don't check through the web interface that something's on the SD card, because everything goes in the logs and that'll give people hints...

# Solution

`Ph0wn{AreWeWeird?}`

On the FortiCam web interface, Storage Management, SD Card, record list shows several videos. The interesting one is `R_20171013_111835.avi`. This video shows a sticker with the password.
