Title: Help X-Men
Author: Cryptax

Stage 1: Help X-Men
----------------

Alert! Somebody stole Scotty's (aka Cyclops) glasses!
You know, Scotty's glasses help him control the beam of energy that come out of his eyes.

Those glasses have been replaced by [Recon Jet](https://www.reconinstruments.com/products/jet/) smart glasses. They look cool, but they have something strange. And they're not the right ones for Scotty.

Can you please help Scotty?


Stage 2: There's more to see
---------------------------------------

There's something (else) to find in the application you noticed during stage 1.

This stage cannot be flagged without stage 1. Or if you manage to, well done, you deserve the points ;P


Stage 3: Smart Caching
--------------------------------

You know all you need to know to complete stage 3.

Errata 1: if row >= 10, you will have 4 letters to encode the coordinates, not 3. For example G17V means column G, row 17 and vertical.

Errata 2: at some point, instead of "KKKKKKKKKK is the key you found during stage 1", you must read "KKKKKKKKKK is the key you found during stage 2".

Rules for this challenge
----------------------------------

- Come and ask for a time slot to get the smart glasses.
- **Please handle the glasses with care** we intend to use them after the CTF!
- **You are NOT authorized to leave the room with the glasses**.
- This is not a hardware challenge, but an IoT challenge ;) You **are not authorized to physically hack the hardware**,(and you won't need to).
- You are **NOT allowed to do a factory reset** on the glasses. **If we see you did so, we will remove 20 points from your team's score**. However, don't worry, a factory reset is intentional, you won't do one accidentally.
- As much as possible, please keep the glasses **charged** for your team, and for other teams. Be fair.
