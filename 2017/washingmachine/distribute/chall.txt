Description:
Check this out: We got this super new and super useless IoT-Device-Prototype.
It's some sort of washing-machine or whatever. 
Appearingly there is some sort of secret hidden in its firmware protected by
anti-reversing and debugging measures.
However, word on the street is that the developer isn't experienced in 
programming embedded devices, so it should be an easy task to exfiltrate the
secret.
Drop by at the ph0wn orga to get your copy of the prototype.

[To solve this challenge, you have to exploit the master-device, which you can
 find on the desk of the ph0wn orga]
