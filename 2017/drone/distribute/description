Apollo mission
- Capsule. Commander, are we ready for takeoff?
- HQ. Sure. All modules are functional. Yet, I can't find the button for ignition. Any possibility on your side?
- Capsule. Negative commander. I guess you need to do the job. Find the link, and reprogram the takeoff procedure.
- HQ. Ok, starting now. But how will I know it worked?
- Capsule. We let you a present under the launch pad. Right after our take off, come to pick up your reward in a special envelop.

Your duty:
Have the drone take off, and then pick up a flag in the envelop located under the drone launch pad.

Rules:
- Book the drone for 10 minutes
- There is no flag in the drone itself
- You are not allowed to reboot the drone or shut it down. If you have to do this, then ask us.
