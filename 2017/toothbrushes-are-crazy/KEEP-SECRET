- Title: Toothbrushes are crazy
- Author: Crypto Girl
- Difficulty: Medium
- Category: Hardware

You know what? I was working (hard, of course) at Fortinet, and then I passed by a phone booth. To my surprise, the phone booth was lit, but nobody inside, except a **toothbrush**.

And the toothbrush was behaving so strangely. Has it gone berserk?! 
I shot two videos of it - see attached files.

To score this challenge, please enter a flag in the form of `FORTI{part1_part2}` where `part1` and `part2` are to discover and uppercase.

# Flag

`FORTI{H4CK_IOT}` or `FORTI{h4ck_iot}` 


# Solution

In the videos we clearly see different sound patterns.

The initial humming is just the beginning (no data).
The high (and short) tone corresponds to dot.
The big buzz corresponds to a dash.
In between, we have a low humming which corresponds to spaces of different lengths.

This is Morse code - see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:International_Morse_Code.svg)

In video 1, we hear
```
.... ....- -.-. -.-
```

which can be translated [online](http://www.onlineconversion.com/morse_code.htm) as `H4CK`

In video 2, we hear
```
.. --- -
```
which decodes to `IOT`

So the flag is `FORTI{H4CK_IOT}`.
