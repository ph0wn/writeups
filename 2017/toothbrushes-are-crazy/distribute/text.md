# Toothbrushes are crazy

You know what? I was working (hard, of course) at Fortinet, and then I passed by a phone booth. To my surprise, the phone booth was lit, but nobody inside, except a **toothbrush**.

And the toothbrush was behaving so strangely. Has it gone beserk?! I shot two videos of it:

- toothbrush1.mp4: sha256: 694b77acbe94e7dd2e0d6b018b283e07a5825adec193b4c57ba0d5f4f45ad68d
- toothbrush2.mp4: sha256: 234e9aea838c78f8e158893ee74a9fb4090316897dcc08e69a30fcb7ac1758c1

**Important**: you must find a flag in the first video and another one in the second video. Those two subflags do not follow the usual `Ph0wn{...}` format for this CTF. Rather you must build a string using this format : `Ph0wn{part1_part2}`. So, more precisely, you add Ph0wn at the beginning, insert the flag found in the first video, add an underscore, add the flag in the second video, put that in brackets, and submit that flag on our CTF server.
