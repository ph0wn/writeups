I spot a crocodile in the bush. Strange, its teeth were **blue**! It probably ate blueberries?

The crocodile seemed tired, __low energy__.
You might need several attempts to communicate with it. Be patient. Crocodiles do not like stress.
Also, be warned that this crocodile disconnects you automatically after 90 seconds.

If you have located what you are after, but fail to communicate repeatedly, come and see us and we'll manage to give you a time slot. We won't bite, promise.
