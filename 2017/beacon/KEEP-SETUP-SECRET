## Setup


You need a BLE dongle on the challenge server.
Install on the challenge server: `sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez`.

`yum install bluez-hcidump bluez-libs bluez-utils bluetooth bluez`


To build the image:
```
docker build -t cryptax/beacon .
```

To deploy:
```
$ sudo service bluetooth stop
$ sudo hciconfig hci0 up
$ docker run -d --rm --privileged --net=host --name beacon-challenge cryptax/beacon
```

or

```
$ docker run -it --rm --privileged --net=host --name beacon-challenge cryptax/beacon /bin/bash
# node main.js
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### See logs

```
$ docker logs beacon-challenge
```

The MAC address of one my dongles is 00:1A:7D:DA:71:06

### Nobody seems to be getting the primary service listing

Do again this. Usually, this is because bluetooth wasn't correctly stopped before launching the docker container.

```bash
$ sudo service bluetooth stop
$ sudo hciconfig hci0 up
$ docker run -d --rm --privileged --net=host --name beacon-challenge cryptax/beacon
```

### Simulateneous connections

| Device                                 | MAC Address          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Dongle of beacon                | 00:1A:7D:DA:71:06 |
| Other dongle                       | 00:1a:7d:da:71:08  |
| My phone                            | 78:c3:e9:7f:47:e9   |
| Fortinet phone motorola      | 65:0a:dd:0d:da:fd  |


Limit: you cannot see the beacon (scan) while somebody is connected to it.
Limit: you cannot connect to the beacon if someone is already connected to it.
Fortunately, there is a timeout (90s) after which you get disconnected.
