Title: Interrupted secrets

Lacking time and always being interrupted at work? Want to throw away your Android phone? what a life!
Unfortunately, this remark s also applies to Android systems. Could these interrupts be used to hide secret messages?

How to be interrupted?

[Download the VM from here]((http://192.168.194.146:8080/challenge-public-files/Ph0wnAndroidChallenge.ova) or [here](https://mega.nz/#!2ZJAWARL!PpWgGAI3WakKnujQifsVqVZtJRwepSkLMQNmChdRZMg) or get it from a USB key.**This file is ~6.2 GB big**

In the VM, log with the default user and the **rootpass** as password.
BEWARE: **the keyboard uses an English layout on the login screen.**

Once logged in, open a terminal and type

```
$ emulator
```

There you go! But again, **don't be interrupted!**
