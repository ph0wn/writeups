In this patched Infocom Interactive Fiction, you will wake up with a
splitting headache for the worst day of your life, as the Earth is going to
be demolished by a fleet of Ph0wn Constructor spaceships... However, you
will have several options in order to grab the Ph0wn flag, either enjoy this
classic game and/or enter the Matrix that hides behind it...

To score, please remove all spaces in the flag you find.
