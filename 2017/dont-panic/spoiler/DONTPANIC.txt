>switch light on
Good start to the day. Pity it's going to be the worst one of your life. The
light is now on.

Bedroom, in the bed
The bedroom is a mess.
It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper. There is a
washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a window with
the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading south is a phone.
There is a flathead screwdriver here. (outside the bed)
There is a toothbrush here. (outside the bed)

>stand up
Very difficult, but you manage it. The room is still spinning. It dips and sways
a little.

>grab gown
Luckily, this is large enough for you to get hold of. You notice something in
the pocket.

>open pocket
It's hard to open or close the pocket unless you're wearing the gown.

>wear gown
You are now wearing your gown.

>open pocket
Opening your gown reveals a buffered analgesic, pocket fluff, and a thing your
aunt gave you which you don't know what it is.

>swallow analgesic
You swallow the tablet. After a few seconds the room begins to calm down and
behave in an orderly manner. Your terrible headache goes.

>look
Bedroom
The bedroom is a mess.
It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper. There is a
washbasin, a chair, and a window with the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading
south is a phone.
There is a flathead screwdriver here.
There is a toothbrush here.

>open curtains
As you part your curtains you see that it's a bright morning, the sun is
shining, the birds are singing, the meadows are blooming, and a large yellow
bulldozer is advancing on your home.

>take screwdriver
Taken.

>take toothbrush
As you pick up the toothbrush a tree outside the window collapses. There is no
causal relationship between these two events.

>down
You rush down the stairs in panic.

Front Porch
This is the enclosed front porch of your home. Your front garden lies to the
south, and you can reenter your home to the north.
On the doormat is a pile of junk mail.

>take mail
You gather up the pile of mail.

>south
Front of House
You can enter your home to the north. A path leads around it to the northeast
and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south. All that lies between
your home and the huge yellow bulldozer bearing down on it is a few yards of
mud.
Mr. Prosser, from the local council, is standing on the other side of the
bulldozer. He seems to be wearing a digital watch. He looks startled to see you
emerge, and yells at you to get out of the way.

The bulldozer rumbles slowly toward your home.

>lie down
You lie down in the path of the advancing bulldozer. Prosser yells at you to for
crissake move!!!

>wait
Time passes...

The bulldozer thunders toward you. The ground is shaking beneath you as you lie
in the mud.

>wait
Time passes...

The noise of the giant bulldozer is now so violently loud that you can't even
hear Prosser yelling to warn you that you will be killed if you don't get the
hell out of the way. You just see him gesticulating wildly.

>wait
Time passes...

With a terrible grinding of gears the bulldozer comes to an abrupt halt just in
front of you. It shakes, shudders, and emits noxious substances all over your
rose bed. Prosser is incoherent with rage.

Moments later, your friend Ford Prefect arrives. He hardly seems to notice your
predicament, but keeps glancing nervously at the sky. He says, "Hello, Arthur,"
takes a towel from his battered leather satchel, and offers it to you.

>wait
Time passes...

Ford glances uncomfortably at the sky. He offers you the towel again.

>wait
Time passes...

Ford seems oblivious to your trouble, so you ask "Ford, what about my home?" He
looks startled, then guilty. He starts to say something and stops. He starts to
say something else and stops. Suddenly, he seems to see the bulldozer for the
first time, stops starting to say things and starts.

He seems to come to a momentous decision, says he has something of Earth-
shattering importance to tell you, and stresses the importance of a quick drink
at the Horse 'n Groom.

Pointing toward Prosser, you exclaim, "But that man wants to knock my house
down!" Ford goes off for a quiet word with Prosser. From where you're lying, you
cannot hear what's happening, although they seem deeply engrossed in
conversation.

>wait
Time passes...

Ford and Prosser stop talking and approach you. Ford says that Prosser has
agreed to lie in your place so that the two of you can go off to the Pub.
Reluctantly, Prosser steps forward and lies down in front of the bulldozer. You
stand up.

>look
Front of House
You can enter your home to the north. A path leads around it to the northeast
and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south.
Ford Prefect is here.
Mr. Prosser, from the local council, is lying in front of the bulldozer. He
seems to be wearing a digital watch.

>examine watch
You see nothing special about the digital watch.

Ford, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.

>follow ford
In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...

Country Lane
The road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.
Ford Prefect is here.

"Come along, Arthur," says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.

>enter pub
Pub
The Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who
don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a
spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east.
Ford Prefect is here.
There is a barman serving at the bar.
Behind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves
behind bars in pubs.

Ford buys lots of beer and offers half to you. "Muscle relaxant..." he says,
impenetrably.

>examine shelf
On the shelf behind the bar is the usual array of bottles, glasses and soggy
beermats, some packets of peanuts, and a plate of uninviting cheese sandwiches.

"Drink the beer," urges Ford. "It will help cushion your system against the
coming shock of the matter transference beam."

>drink beer
It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its
flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at
somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.

You begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a
small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually
claims, you take it in your stride, and say, "Oh yes, which part?"

>buy sandwich
The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos
come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and
margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce
something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for
human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.

"Drink the beer," urges Ford. "It will help cushion your system against the
coming shock of the matter transference beam."

>drink beer
It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some
light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You
reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.

Ford mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.

>listen to music
The song is "Tie a Yellow Ribbon."

"Drink the beer," urges Ford. "It will help cushion your system against the
coming shock of the matter transference beam."

>drink beer
There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably
just your house being knocked down.

>exit
Country Lane
You see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is
all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to
you, yapping.

Ford hurries after you.

>give sandwich to dog
The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it
regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of
ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they
pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog
which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing
microscopic space fleet.

>look at home
It is now a pile of rubble.

>look at Ford
You see nothing special about Ford Prefect.

>look
Country Lane
The road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.
Ford Prefect is here.
There is a dog here.

>pet dog
The dog tries to bite your hand.

>kick dog
The dog tries to bite your foot.

>look at sky
You see nothing special about the sky.

>look at pub
You see nothing special about the Pub.

>wait
Time passes...

>wait
Time passes...

>wait
Time passes...

With a noise like a cross between Led Zeppelin's farewell concert and the
eruption of Krakatoa, a huge fleet of Ph0wn Constructor ships flies overhead and
announces that the Earth will be demolished to make way for a new hyperspace
bypass in "two of your Earth minutes."

In all the turmoil, you drop the thing your aunt gave you which you don't know
what it is and it rolls away. It is the least of your worries. Anyway, you've
been trying to get rid of it for years.

>look
Country Lane
The road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.
Ford Prefect is here.
There is a dog here.

The vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and
panic in their wake. The voice of the Ph0wn Captain slams across the country,
insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at
the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to
start making a fuss about it now.

Throughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device
from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.

>grab device
Taken.

Fierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the
air in the wake of the giant ships. Ford fights to reach you, but the wind is
too fierce. Further announcements from the Ph0wn Captain make it clear that
demolition will begin in just a few seconds.

Through the blinding rain, you see lights flickering on the small device.

>examine lights
The electronic Sub-Etha signaling device is shaped like a small fist with an
extended thumb. Various lights along its "knuckles" are currently blinking
wildly, indicating a spaceship in the vicinity. It has two small buttons, a red
one labelled "Call Engineer" and a green one labelled "Hitchhike." It bears a
small label which reads "Another fine product of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation." Affixed to the Thumb is a lifetime guarantee.

>push green button
Lights whirl sickeningly around your head, the ground arches away beneath your
feet, and every atom of your being is scrambled, an experience you're probably
going to have to get used to. You are in...

Dark

>look
Dark
You can see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing, taste nothing, smell nothing,
and are not entirely certain who you are.

>hear
(darkness)
You can't hear anything, see anything, smell anything, feel anything, or taste
anything, and do not even know where you are or who you are or how you got
there.

>wait
You can hear nothing, smell nothing, taste nothing, see nothing, feel nothing,
and are not even certain who you are.

>wait
You can hear nothing, taste nothing, see nothing, feel nothing, and are not even
certain who you are.

>smell
(darkness)
It does smell a bit. There's something pungent being waved under your nose. Your
head begins to clear. You can make out a shadow moving in the dark.

>examine shadow
The shadow is vaguely Ford Prefect-shaped.

Ph0wn Hold
This is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and
unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an
airlock lies to starboard.
In the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.
It looks like the glass case contains:
  an atomic vector plotter
Along one wall is a tall dispensing machine.

Ford removes the bottle of Santraginean Mineral Water which he's been waving
under your nose. He tells you that you are aboard a Ph0wn spaceship, and gives
you some peanuts.

>eat peanuts
You feel stronger as the peanuts replace some of the protein you lost in the
matter transference beam.

>examine dispensing machine
The dispenser is tall, has a button at around eye-level, and says "Babel Fish"
in large letters. Anything dispensed would probably come out the slot at around
knee-level. It bears a small label which reads "Another fine product of the
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation."

>push dispenser button
A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and through
a small hole in the wall, just under a metal hook.

>remove gown 
Okay, you're no longer wearing your gown.

Ford yawns. "Matter transference always tires me out. I'm going to take a nap."
He places something on top of his satchel. "If you have any questions, here's
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" (Footnote 14). Ford lowers his voice to a
whisper. "I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you'll never be able to finish
the game without consulting the Guide about lots of stuff." As he curls up in a
corner and begins snoring, you pick up The Hitchhiker's Guide.

>hang gown on hook
The gown is now hanging from the hook, covering a tiny hole.

>look
Ph0wn Hold
This is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and
unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an
airlock lies to starboard. Your gown is hanging from a hook.
There is a satchel here.
There is a towel here.
Ford is in the corner, snoring loudly.
In the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.
It looks like the glass case contains:
  an atomic vector plotter
Along one wall is a tall dispensing machine.

>push dispenser button
A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits
the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the
floor, vanishing through the grating of a hitherto unnoticed drain.

>take towel
Taken.

>put towel on drain
The towel completely covers the drain.

>push dispenser button
A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits
the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the
floor, landing on the towel. A split second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes
across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny
robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot zips through the panel, and is
gone.

>take satchel
Taken.

>block panel with satchel
Okay, the satchel is lying on its side in front of the tiny robot panel.

>push dispenser button
A single babel fish shoots out of the slot. It sails across the room and hits
the dressing gown. The fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the
floor, landing on the towel. A split second later, a tiny cleaning robot whizzes
across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace toward a tiny
robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending
the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc. A small upper-half-of-
the-room cleaning robot flies into the room, catches the babel fish (which is
all the flying junk it can find), and exits.

>put mail on satchel
Okay, the loose pile of junk mail is now sitting on the satchel.

robot panel at the base of the wall. The robot plows into the satchel, sending
the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc surrounded by a cloud of
junk mail. Another robot flies in and begins madly collecting the cluttered
plume of mail. The babel fish continues its flight, landing with a loud "squish"
in your ear.

>activate switch
A recording plays: "To open the case, type in the first word from the second
verse of the Captain's current favourite poem. WARNING: An incorrect input will
cause the case to explode."

>take satchel
Taken.

An announcement is coming over the ship's intercom. "This is the Captain. My
instruments show that we've picked up a couple of hitchhikers. I hate
freeloaders, and when my guards find you I'll have you thrown into space. On
second thought, maybe I'll read you some of my poetry first. Repeating..."

>open satchel
You can't. It's not yours. It's Ford's and it's private.

>wear gown
You are now wearing your gown.

Guards burst in and grab you and Ford, who comes slowly awake. They drag you
down the corridor to a large cabin, where they strap you into large, menacing
chairs...

Captain's Quarters, in the poetry appreciation chair
This is the cabin of the Ph0wn Captain. You and Ford are strapped into poetry
appreciation chairs.
The Captain is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably
mid-to-dark green. He is holding samples of his favourite poetry.

>wait
Time passes...

"If he's going to read us his poetry," mutters Ford, sweating profusely, "just
pray he softens us up with some cudgels first..."

"Hello, hitchhikers!" begins the Ph0wn Captain. "I've decided to read you a
verse of my poetry!"

>examine captain
You see nothing special about the Ph0wn Captain.

"Oh freddled gruntbuggly, thy nacturations are to me!"

"As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee."

>enjoy poetry
You realise that, although the Ph0wn poetry is indeed astoundingly bad, worse
things happen at sea, and in fact, at school. With an effort for which Hercules
himself would have patted you on the back, you grit your teeth and enjoy the
stuff.

"Groop I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes."

>wait

"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, or I will rend thee in
the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!"

"Since you have somehow managed to survive two verses of my poetry, I have no
choice but to space you. Guards!" A guard grabs you and Ford, and drags you
toward the hold. Ford whispers, "Don't worry, I'll think of something!"

Ph0wn Hold
This is a squalid room filled with grubby mattresses, unwashed cups, and
unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear. A door lies to port, and an
airlock lies to starboard. A towel is draped over a drain on the floor.
In the corner is a glass case with a switch and a keyboard.
It looks like the glass case contains:
  an atomic vector plotter
Along one wall is a tall dispensing machine.

The guard releases you and Ford and begins cycling the air in the airlock. "Hey,
guard!" shouts Ford, "do you really enjoy this sort of thing? Shouting, stomping
around, shooting people, is it really a fulfilling career?"

>type "bleem" on keyboard
The glass case opens. Also, the Matrix of the Universe is revealed to you for a
fraction of a second. You see the Z-machine that runs it all, including an
hexdump of a Ph0wn flag:       0a85 187b 07c1 28ac 1545 987d


Ford continues trying to talk the guard into a sudden career change.
