Install the SDK somewhere and add the bin/ folder in the $path

Build the a full binary (by default gcc is in RV32 mode):
riscv-nuclei-elf-gcc -c -o shellcode.o shellcode.S
(the full command is: riscv-nuclei-elf-gcc -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -mcmodel=medlow -c -o shellcode.o shellcode.S  but with the default compiler option it works)

Disassemble it to check everything is OK:
riscv-nuclei-elf-objdump -d shellcode.o

Keep only the text section of the current lib object:
riscv-nuclei-elf-objcopy -O binary -j .text shellcode.o shellcode.bin

Copy the shellcode in you favorite script tool:
hexdump -e '/1 "%02X "' shellcode.bin
