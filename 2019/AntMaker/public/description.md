To receive the signal, you have to fabricate a RHCP antenna at 868MHz.

Use the 3D_ant file as a model to mount the antenna. Collect your PCBs and use some tools and a soldering iron.

Once your are ready, register on list to test if your prototype can receive the signal. 3 teams will make the test each 30mn.

The Master of the Chamber, *Fabien*, will guide you to the anechoic room.
