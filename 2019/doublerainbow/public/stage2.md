This time, Katy has not done the same mistake and she asked Britney to
validate the challenge. Good Luck!

Same principle for this Level than for Level 1: We provide on USB keys
a compressed image of the Data partition of the microSD card. Find the
code using this image and validate your finding on the actual hardware
to get the flag (same hardware than for Level 1).

Attachements:
- The schema of the hardware used by the challenge (same as for
Level 1)
- USB key: (or on our FTP site `10.210.17.66` id: `ph0wn` pwd: `ph0wn2019`)
