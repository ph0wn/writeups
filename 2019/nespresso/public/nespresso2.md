You've got the authorization code from "Me want coffee 1"? Well done! You probably have understood when to use it.
Now is time to brew a coffee!

**Your mission**: brew a remote coffee, **without using the official app, nor pressing any button** on the coffee machine, apart the slider.

**How to get the flag**: when you are ready, call us to validate the flag. We will ask you to brew a coffee in front of our eyes. We count on you to be fair play, and in doubt, we have a couple of ways to check you are not cheating >:)

**Do not attempt to connect to the Coffee Machine with your own smartphone**.
Instead, come by the organizer's desk to request a time slot. We will lend you a pre-configured smartphone - it will save you lots of time probably - and you will get access to the Coffee Machine during that time slot.

Helpful notes:

- Bluetooth is a bit "buggy". If something does not work the first time but you think it should, we recommend you try a couple of times ;P
- With Bluetooth, you can only pair 1 device at a given time (except bugs...). So, when you need to pair your laptop to the coffee machine, you must remove the pairing from the smartphone. The correct way to do this is via the Nespresso app, "Delete this machine" ("Supprimer cette machine"). Removing the pairing via Android's Bluetooth panel is **not sufficient**.
- The authorization code you got at stage 1 was only valid in June, and it will likely have changed on ph0wn's day. You need to retrieve the correct authorization code.
