# This smartphone is for Me Want Coffee 2 and Me Want Exactly 90mL**

- Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F
- RF8J82R92SN

It is pre-configured with apps that will save you lots of time:

- It has the Nespresso app pre-installed, along with a few Bluetooth apps ;)
- It is rooted
- Bluetooth logs are enabled and you will find them in `/data/log/bt` (root required)

NB. Stricly speaking, the smartphone is not necessary to solve Nespresso challenges, but we believe it will help.

# What you may do

- Use the Nespresso app or nRF connect app
- Connect the phone via ADB to retrieve Bluetooth logs. They are in `/data/log/bt`.
- Enable / Disable Bluetooth
- Check Bluetooth pairing, pair, unpair

# Forbidden

All the rest is **Strictly Forbidden** (and won't help you). For instance, you are **not allowed to hack, lock, brick, change password, install apps, uninstall apps etc**.

This challenge is really fun. Thanks for your understanding.
