You've flagged "Me want coffee" stages 1 and 2? Wow. I'm impressed!
Now, let's do some *real* hacking.
Your mission, should you accept it, is to **brew a 90 mL coffee** remotely, in one go.
That's less than a standard Lungo, but more than an Espresso.
Have fun!!!

**How to validate the flag**: ask an organizer. We will check you haven't touched the coffee machine - except the slider - and that the coffee was brewed in one go (no pause). We validate the challenge with our marked cup of 90 mL. In case of doubt, we will ask you to demo again.

**All rules of Me Want Coffee 2 apply**. In particular, we insist that you do not connect your own smartphones to the coffee machine.
