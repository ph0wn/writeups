We've just received an emergency call from an operator of the Radiology service. He can't remember his credentials to logon the radiography system, and the emergency HIPAA feature has been disabled by our previous Infosec manager ;(

Of course, the X-Ray is urgent. Please assist the operator.

You can access it on `http://10.210.17.66:21346`.
