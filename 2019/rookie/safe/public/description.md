Does it contain gold? Maybe!

We have intercepted  the following message:
4L3 2R5 2L7 1Rx with "x" being a character that is unfortunately non readable ...

After studying this message for a very long time, we have discovered that "R" means "Right" and "L" means "Left".
Also, xRy means "Roll the wheel on the right, and stops at the xth y you meet".
For instance, 4R3 means turns the wheel until you have seen 4 times the figure 3 pointed by the arrow. Do stop exactly at the 4th "3" turning the wheel in the right direction.

Good luck ... you might become rich!

The safe is located by the organizer's desk. See image.
