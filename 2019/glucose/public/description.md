I swear I saw a masked attacker come with a big syringe and a huge needle infect those glucose sensors for diabetics.
What did he inject in those NFC sensors?!

- Come and get a sensor at the organizer desk (see the attached image to recognize the device you need to get)
- If you need a smartphone with NFC, you may borrow one at the organizer's desk. If you have one, it's better you use your own.
