The word to guess is `y@cht` but unfortunately the keyboard does not have `@` (neither normal keyboard nor l33t keyboard).

- Unzip the app
- Locate `libapp.so`
- Search for `y@cht`
- Replace with `yacht`
- Resign the apk
- Play the game, enter `yacht` and get the flag!

Flag: `ph0wn{Dart_is_soooo_opaque_isnt_it}`
