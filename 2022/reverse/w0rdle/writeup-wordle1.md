# w0rdle 1

Stage 1 is a **Rookie**. You need to find the word "ph0wn". 
With the normal keyboard, you can't print numbers, but there is a l33t keyboard option in the app.
If you use that, you'll be able to write `ph0wn` and get the flag.

Another option is to unzip the APK, and do strings on `libapp.so`. We find the flag for stage 1.

- Flag: `ph0wn{you_w1n_darts_stage1}`
