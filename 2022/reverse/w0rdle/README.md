- Pico le Croco   - "Hi Croco'Ado. Yes, I know wordle. It's a game where you have to guess a 5-letter word. So easy."
- Croc'Ado        - "Ha! U're 2 old and rusty to solve this one :D"
- Pico le Croco   - "Me? Old and Rusty?!"
- Croc'Ado        - "You might find _stage 1_ if U're lucky. It's a Rookie. But you'll neveR find _Stage 2_. N0b0dy knows how to solve it."

Those teenagers really have no respect. Actually, this w0rdle turns out to be more difficult than expected. Please help Pico le Croco.
He'll reward you with flags :)


## W0rdle 1

W0rdle 1 is *very very simple*. You don't even need to code or read code ;P

- [Write-up for stage 1](./writeup-wordle1.md) - it's a write-up so it spoils it!

## W0rdle 2

W0rdle 2 was meant to be difficult... except there was an (unintended) flaw! A smart hack reveals the flag.

- [Write-up for stage2](./writeup-wordle2.md) - it's a write-up so it spoils it!

## W0rdle 3

W0rdle 3 should be as difficult! This challenge was added after Ph0wn 2022. 
Normally, it fixes the flaw of Stage 2 ;-)
