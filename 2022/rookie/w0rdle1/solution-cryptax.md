# Description

Croc'Ado - "Hey, Pico, I've implemented a new game, called w0rdle" 

Pico le Croco - "Hi Croco'Ado. Yes, I know wordle. It's a game where you have to guess a 5-letter word. So easy." 

Croc'Ado - "Ha! U're 2 old and rusty to solve this one :D" 

Pico le Croco - "Me? Old and Rusty?!" 

Croc'Ado - "You might find stage 1 if U're lucky. It's a Rookie. But you'll neveR find Stage 2. N0b0dy knows how to solve it." 

Pico le Croco - "You brag too much Croc'Ado. Let me show you my skills."

Those teenagers really have no respect. Actually, this w0rdle turns out to be more difficult than expected. Please help Pico le Croco. He'll reward you with flags :)

-    The app is `w0rdle.apk`. It has been tested on Android Emulator 10 & 11. It is not malicious.
-    The same app is to be used for Stage 1 and Stage 2. To switch between both stages, find the button "New Game".

App to be provided later. I want to update with stage 3 :)

# Solution 

You need to find the word "ph0wn". With the normal keyboard, you can't print numbers, but there is a *l33t* keyboard option in the app.
If you use that, you'll be able to write `ph0wn` and get the flag.
Another option is to unzip the APK, and do strings on `libapp.so`. We find the flag for stage 1.

`ph0wn{you_w1n_darts_stage1}`
