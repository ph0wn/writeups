Pico lost a flag. He can't remember where it is on the PCB. Stupid, isn't it?

1. Locate Pico's memory
2. Look under the carpet. The hot air stations might help you.
3. You'll need to put everything back in place for stage 2.


Notes:

- This challenge and the entire design of the PCB is brought to you by **Balda** :)
- Keep the PCBs at the end of Ph0wn, they are kindly sponsored by Fortinet :)
- Grab the PICO PCB by the soldering stand. **Only 1 per team please**. 
- You unlock stage 2 if you get the flag of stage 1 *or* if you find an unlock message.
