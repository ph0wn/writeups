Pico le Croco bought a Hummer EV SUV to go off tracks during his vacation.

The device which handles the charging of the battery is a ESP32-*PICO* chip (yes, that's partly why Pico bought the car), known as ["M5StickC PLUS2"](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/M5StickC%20PLUS2). Arg! The implementation is riddled with issues! Pico hired you to secure it.

Read the source code, patch it and upload it to a M5 device (M5StickC Plus, M5StickC Plus 2, M5StickC, or M5 Core 2). Then, go challenge the organizers, hand them your patched M5, and tell them they have no guts to retrieve the flag which is planted in your device.

- If the organizers fail with exploit of category 1, you get a flag for *Defend 1*
- If the organizers fail with exploit of category 2, you get a flag for *Defend 2*
- Both flags are independant.

If the organizers succeed, you'll only have *one single* other attempt (so max 2 attempts in all).

Due to manual validation from organizers, this challenge will close at **6.30 pm** (or earlier if we are overloaded!).
