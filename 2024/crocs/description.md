Pico le Croco is a stylish crocodile who loves driving his sleek Ferrari or his luxurious Rolls Royce. He particularly enjoys visiting Cote d'Azur, one of the rare regions of France with many polyglots and delicacies. Being a sneaky hunter, he has hidden the sign warning about him, as well as his 24 stops to his destination.

This is *not* a steganography challenge.
The flag uses format "phown{...}", not "ph0wn" as usual.
