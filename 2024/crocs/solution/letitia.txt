Pico is a sneaky crocodile. Can you figure out the key and his next meal?

The challenge is a zip with a text file and crocodile pictures. Keep the
text file and its name in mind since it contains hints about the key when
you find it.

But if you look at the zip file, you’ll notice it starts with “%PDF”. This
file is a polyglot, or file that is valid in multiple formats. Rename the
zip to .pdf, and open it to see something entirely different.

All you see is a single page pdf with a crocodile who is on the move. But if
you look at the file in detail, you notice many page entries beyond the
single page. If you go to the /Pages object, you’ll notice that there are
actually 27 Page objects linked, even if the /Length field is set to 1. Edit
the file in hexedit to change the 1 to a 27, and you’ll see many more
crocodiles and list of coordinates. Pico doesn’t like the sign warning his
food about him.

By using pdftotext, you can easily extract all the sets of coordinates. With
some processing from a library like JPX, the list of coordinates can be
turned into a gpx file. Then, open the gpx file with an online viewer, and
the tracks form “ph0wn{PICOVISITS_______}. As previously hinted, the key is
all caps and 24 characters long. To find what the blanks mean, look around
and see what the single coordinate points to, which is EURECOM. Now is
probably a good time to work from home until Pico has eaten!
