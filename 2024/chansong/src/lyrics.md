# ANTHEM

Have you seen that crocodile, gliding on a board?
It’s wild, it’s strange, but trust me, don't be bored
Just hear this chord play from dawn to night’s throne
It’s the anthem we know—it’s the song of Phown!

Cicadas sing under tall, shady pines,
The computers glitch while Pico’s teeth shine
You won’t believe the sights you’re shown
But guess what? Yeah, it's Phown!

I bet you’re searching for clues I might hide
Yet somewhere in these lines, they abide
Or maybe not, I’ll leave that unknown
'Cause that’s how we roll here at Phown!

Have you seen that crocodile, gliding on a board?
It’s wild, it’s strange, but trust me, don't be bored
Just hear this chord play from dawn to night’s throne
It’s the anthem we know—it’s the song of Phown!


# LISTENME

Listen to my isomorphic song
Which maps the pitch classes to a set of symbols
The pitch classes are C, C sharp, and span up to B
And symbols span from 0 to 9, plus an A and a B

It maps C to 0, C sharp to 1, you see?
D is mapped to 2, D sharp is mapped to three
That continues until the mapping is complete
A sharp to symbol A, and B to symbol B
If you’ve caught on, the key you’ll trace,
Hidden in a twelve-tone, dodecaphonic space.

That’s my isomorphic song, I’m done,
Good luck to you, and happy Phown!
