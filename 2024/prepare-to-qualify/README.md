Those challenges were created by Euphoric.

- Stage 1 was solved once for 500 points.
- Stage 2 was solved once for 30 points. Stage 2 cannot be done without Stage 1.

The challenge provided several cassettes and cassette readers.
The difficulty of the challenge was to grab the data from the cassettes. If you want to play the challenge without the equipment, you can assume you recovered `Ph0wn.cas` (but it makes stage 1 far easier to solve).
