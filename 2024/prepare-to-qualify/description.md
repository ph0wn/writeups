A nice racing game is on a cassette close to the organizer's desk. Want to play for a flag?

Stage 1. Prepare to qualify for a flag :)
Stage 2. Win the qualification round for another flag :) This stage cannot be completed without first flagging stage 1.

Cassettes and cassette readers are old prehistoric models which require to be handled with care. Please be gentle to them, they are the personal belongings of some ph0wn participants...
