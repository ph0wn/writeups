R2D2 is competing in a geocaching podrace. The droid received hexadecimal information from its ultrasound sensor and its infrared scanner:

- Ultrasound: 336863
- Infrared: 704320

Cosmic rays have potentially altered one character of that data (0 if you're lucky, 1 character at most). To check data validity, R2D2 uses CRC-8/LTE. If the checksum is correct, data is fine. If the checksum is incorrect, you'll need to fix the data.

- CRC-8/LTE Ultrasound: 0x2A
- CRC-8/LTE Infrared: 0xF6

Let's assume correct data for ultrasound is ABCDEF, and GHIJKL for infrared. Go to GPS coordinates N 4A°BC.DEF et E 0G°HI.JKL (yes, you need to leave the building). You'll find a hidden "surprise box" - the size of a small apple - at that location.

**Do not remove the box**, leave it in place! Unscrew the bottom, take a picture of the flag, and flag! Put everything back in the box (including the flag), close it and hide it again as you found it.
